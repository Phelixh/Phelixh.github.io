- I am an Applied Mathematics Instructor in [Department of Mathematics](https://math.mit.edu/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/).
- I received my Ph.D. in [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), working with [Prof. George Em Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis), in 2020. I received my B.Eng. degree in [Department of Thermal Engineering](http://www.te.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/teen/index.html) at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn) in 2013.
- My current research interests are on scientific machine learning and deep learning theory. My broad research interests focus on computational biology and high performance computing.
